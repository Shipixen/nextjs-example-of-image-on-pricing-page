## How to add an image to the pricing plans

1. Update the `PricingTier` interface

```tsx
export interface PricingTier {
  name: string;
  id: string;
  href: string;
  discountPrice: string | Record<string, string>;
  price: string | Record<string, string>;
  description: string | React.ReactNode;
  features: string[];
  featured?: boolean;
  highlighted?: boolean;
  cta: string;
  soldOut?: boolean;
  image?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

2. Add the image to each of the items in the `pricingTiers` array

```tsx
export const pricingTiers: PricingTier[] = [
  {
    name: 'Free',
    id: '0',
    href: '/subscribe',
    price: { '1': '$0', '2': '$0' },
    discountPrice: { '1': '', '2': '' },
    description: `Get all goodies for free, no credit card required.`,
    features: [
      `Multi-platform compatibility`,
      `Real-time notification system`,
      `Advanced user permissions`,
    ],
    featured: false,
    highlighted: false,
    soldOut: false,
    cta: `Sign up`,
    image: <img src="/static/images/backdrop-1.webp" alt="Free" />,
  },
  // ...
  // do the same for the other items if any
];
```

3. Add the image to the pricing page `app/pricing/page.tsx`

```tsx
// ...find where the description is rendered and add {image} under it (or anywhere you want the image to be displayed)
    <p
      className={cn(
        tier.featured
          ? 'text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-500'
          : 'text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400',
        'mt-4 text-sm leading-6',
      )}
    >
      {tier.description}

      {/* Display the image here */}
      {tier.image}
    </p>
// ...
```

## Deploy

**Vercel**

The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Netlify**

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)â€™s Next.js runtime configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR), `next/images`, etc.

See [Next.js on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime) for suggested configuration values and more details.

**Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.**
